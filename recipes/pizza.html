        It’s easy to make this thin crust pizza dough recipe with a few ingredients you may likely already have on hand. Here’s what you’ll need: 

        Yeast: This thin crust pizza dough starts with one teaspoon of active dry yeast. 
        Sugar and water: Activate the yeast in white sugar and lukewarm water.
        Flour: This crispy thin crust calls for all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. 
        Salt: Salt tightens the gluten structure, which strengthens the dough and makes it more elastic.
